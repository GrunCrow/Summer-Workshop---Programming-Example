# Summer-Workshop - Programming-Example

This repository includes documents that are Programming Examples for the Application for CV4Ecology Summer Workshop. 

It is important to have into account that those files are part of different projects such as [Animal Recognition Neural Network](https://github.com/GrunCrow/Animal_Recognition_Neural_Network) which is not about animals at all as it has been first implemented with mnist dataset (digits). Some other code examples are available in a private way.

This repository includes the following files:

1. *classification_training_notebook.ipynb*: Notebook with a classification Jupyter Notebook. Where it takes the data from a csv and load the images from the paths stored in the csv. It also creates a model and trains it.
2. *classification_training_notebook - prueba data augmentation.ipynb*: It is a copy of the previous notebook with some improvements such us data augmentation and graphics to show the evolution. It also trains a model that already exists and already has been trained.
3. *1_Pre_Procesamiento_PC.ipynb*: Preprocess data and create csv
4. *2_datasets_creation.ipynb*: Divide data into 3: train, test and validation
5. *01_CSV_datasets_creation.ipynb*: From the data CSV creates the train, test and validation csvs. It is the newer version of data preprocessing.
